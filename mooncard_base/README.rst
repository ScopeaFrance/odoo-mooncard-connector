=============
Mooncard Base
=============

This is the base module of the Odoo-Mooncard connector. `Mooncard <http://www.mooncard.co/>`_ is a new-generation corporate card that propose:

* instant notification of each card payment on your mobile phone,
* easy and fast recording of your card expenses from your mobile phone.

Mooncard is only available in France for the moment, but it will be extended to other countries in the future.

This module doesn't do anything useful by itself. It must be used together with:

* the module *mooncard_invoice* if the Mooncard is attached to the bank account of the company,
* the module *mooncard_expense* (to be developped) if the Mooncard is attached to the private bank account of the employee.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need some additional Python librairies:

.. code::

  sudo pip install pycountry
  sudo pip install unicodecsv

Note: you should not use the Debian/Ubuntu package *python-pycountry* because, as of Ubuntu 16.04, the version is too old and has a slightly different API than the latest version of `pycountry on Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycountry/>`_ (and we are using the latest version of the API of pycountry in this module).

Configuration
=============

The Mooncard products have been configured with a generic supplier *Mooncard Misc Suppliers* and a special *Supplier Product Code*: don't change those parameters!

In the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Miscellaneous > Moon Cards*, you must create your Moon Cards, one for each of your Mooncards.

In the Mooncard Web interface `app.mooncard.co <https://app.mooncard.co/>`_, go to *Paramètres > Natures de dépense* and update the column *Compte de charge* so that it matches exactly the account codes that you have in Odoo.

Usage
=====

Go to the menu *Accounting > Mooncard > Mooncard Import* and upload the CSV file that you downloaded from your `Mooncard account <https://app.mooncard.co/>`_ under *Comptes > Relevés et soldes > Exporter > Odoo*:

* Odoo will create the new Mooncard transactions,
* Odoo will update the existing Mooncard transactions that are still in draft.

For mileage expenses, use the same Odoo menu and upload the CSV file that you downloaded from your `Mooncard account <https://app.mooncard.co/>`_ under *Dépenses > Frais kilométriques > Exporter*.

Roadmap
=======

* When the Mooncard webservices will be available, the module will be updated: the mooncard transactions will be automatically downloaded.
